### **1. Time Complexity:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Best Case** | **Average Case** | **Worst Case** | **Remarks**                                       |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | `O(n)`        | `O(n^2)`         | `O(n^2)`       | Best case is `O(n)` with an optimization (no swaps). |
| **Selection Sort**  | `O(n^2)`      | `O(n^2)`         | `O(n^2)`       | Time complexity is always `O(n^2)` regardless of input. |
| **Insertion Sort**  | `O(n)`        | `O(n^2)`         | `O(n^2)`       | Best case is `O(n)` when the array is nearly or fully sorted. |

### **2. Space Complexity:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Space Complexity** | **In-Place** | **Remarks**                                       |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | `O(1)`               | Yes          | No extra memory needed apart from a few variables. |
| **Selection Sort**  | `O(1)`               | Yes          | In-place sorting with no extra memory needed.      |
| **Insertion Sort**  | `O(1)`               | Yes          | In-place sorting with no extra memory needed.      |

All three algorithms are **in-place** sorting algorithms, meaning they do not require additional memory (beyond a few variables) and sort the array in-place.

### **3. Stability:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Stability** | **Remarks**                                           |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Stable        | If two elements have the same value, their relative order is preserved. |
| **Selection Sort**  | Not Stable    | Relative order of equal elements may not be preserved due to swapping. |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Stable        | Preserves the relative order of equal elements.       |

- **Stable Sorting**: A sorting algorithm is stable if the order of elements with the same value is preserved in the sorted output.

---

### **4. Adaptiveness:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Adaptive** | **Remarks**                                           |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Yes (if optimized) | Can terminate early if the array becomes sorted during the process. |
| **Selection Sort**  | No           | Always scans the entire array, even if it is already sorted. |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Yes          | Efficient for nearly sorted arrays with a best case of `O(n)`. |

- **Adaptive Sorting**: An algorithm is adaptive if it performs better when the input is partially or fully sorted.

---

### **5. Number of Swaps:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Swaps**         | **Remarks**                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Many              | In the worst case, it may make multiple swaps in each pass. |
| **Selection Sort**  | Few (`n-1` swaps) | Always makes at most `n-1` swaps (1 per pass).        |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Few               | Shifts elements instead of swapping, so it usually makes fewer swaps. |

- **Selection Sort** has a fixed number of swaps, but **Bubble Sort** can have many swaps depending on the input. **Insertion Sort** usually has fewer swaps because it shifts elements instead of making actual swaps.

---

### **6. Simplicity of Implementation:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Ease of Implementation** | **Remarks**                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Simple                     | Easy to understand and implement.                |
| **Selection Sort**  | Simple                     | Also easy to implement.                          |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Simple                     | Slightly more complex than Bubble and Selection, but still simple. |

All three algorithms are easy to understand and implement. However, **Insertion Sort** requires a bit more thinking due to the shifting of elements, but it’s still straightforward.

### **7. Use Cases:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Use Cases**                                      | **Remarks**                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Educational purposes, small datasets.             | Rarely used in practice due to inefficiency but helpful for learning basic sorting concepts. |
| **Selection Sort**  | Small datasets, situations where swaps are costly. | Not adaptive, but useful when minimizing swaps is important (e.g., for devices with limited memory for swaps). |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Small datasets, nearly sorted data, real-time systems. | Efficient for small or nearly sorted data; commonly used in practice when sorting small arrays. |

- **Bubble Sort** is mainly used for educational purposes or very small datasets.
- **Selection Sort** is useful when minimizing the number of swaps is more important than time complexity.
- **Insertion Sort** is quite efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays, which makes it useful in practice for such scenarios.

### **8. Practical Efficiency:**

| **Algorithm**      | **Practical Efficiency** | **Remarks**                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Poor                     | Slow for large datasets due to `O(n^2)` time complexity. |
| **Selection Sort**  | Poor                     | Inefficient for large datasets (`O(n^2)` time complexity) but has fewer swaps. |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Decent for small datasets | Performs well on small datasets or when the input is nearly sorted (`O(n)` in the best case). |

**Insertion Sort** is generally more practical compared to **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort** due to its adaptiveness and efficiency on small datasets.

### When to Use Which Algorithm:

- **Bubble Sort**:  
  - Use this for **educational purposes** or when you want to learn the basic concepts of sorting. It’s inefficient and should not be used for large datasets.

- **Selection Sort**:  
  - Use this when **minimizing the number of swaps** is more important than the number of comparisons. It's also used when you don’t care about the algorithm being adaptive or stable.

- **Insertion Sort**:  
  - Use this when the data is **nearly sorted** or when sorting small datasets. It's practical for small input sizes or real-time applications where the input is almost sorted.

---

### Conclusion:

While **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Insertion Sort** are simple and easy-to-implement sorting algorithms, they are generally not used for large datasets due to their `O(n^2)` time complexity. However, **Insertion Sort** has some practical applications, especially when working with small datasets or nearly sorted data.

For larger datasets, you would typically look into more efficient algorithms like **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, or **Heap Sort**, which have much better time complexities (`O(n log n)`).
